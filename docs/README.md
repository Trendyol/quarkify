> A magical ui library generator.

## What it is

Quarkify is a complete ui-library which has been written using React and TypeScript.
There are many great UI libraries for react available but almost all of them are highly customizable and full of boilerplate code, so we decided to create our own lightweight React Component library and you should give it a try.

Here's why:

* Your time will be spent doing actual work instead of creating simple components.
* You will not worry about consistency across your components.
* Each component is implemented with accessibility in mind. smile
