# Radio

## Fluid
Adding fluid prop to radio element makes the component spread into the div's width.

```
<Radio fluid name={"vehicle1"} value={"Bike"} label={"I have a bike"}/>
```

## Label
It is also possible to add label next to the radio by giving label property

```
<Radio fluid name={"vehicle1"} value={"Bike"} label={"I have a bike"}/>
```

#### Additional content
You can use any other HTML radio properties:
```
<Radio id="1" disabled name={"vehicle1"} value={"Bike"} label={"I have a bike"}/>
```
