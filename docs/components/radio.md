# Radio

## Label
It is also possible to add label next to the radio by giving label property

```
<Radio fluid name={"vehicle1"} value={"Bike"} label={"I have a bike"}/>
```

## Error
Adding error prop to radio element changes the component's style to indicate an error has happened.

```
<Radio error name={"vehicle1"} value={"Bike"} label={"I have a bike"}/>
```

#### Additional content
You can use any other HTML radio properties:
```
<Radio id="1" disabled name={"vehicle1"} value={"Bike"} label={"I have a bike"}/>
```
