<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][home-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great UI libraries for react available but almost all of them are
highly customizable and full of boilerplate code, so we decided to create our own
lightweight React Component library and you should give it a try.

Here's why:
* Your time will be spent doing actual work instead of creating simple components.
* You will not worry about consistency across your components.
* Each component is implemented with accessibility in mind. :smile:

You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue with the tag.
