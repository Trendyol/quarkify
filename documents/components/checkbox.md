# Checkbox

## Label
It is also possible to add label next to the checkbox by giving label property

```
<CheckBox fluid name={"vehicle1"} value={"Bike"} label={"I have a bike"}/>
```

## Error
Adding error prop to checkbox element changes the component's style to indicate an error has happened.

```
<CheckBox error name={"vehicle1"} value={"Bike"} label={"I have a bike"}/>
```

#### Additional content
And of course you can use any other HTML checkbox properties:
```
<CheckBox id="1" disabled name={"vehicle1"} value={"Bike"} label={"I have a bike"}/>
```
