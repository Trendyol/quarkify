# Loader
A loader is a component to display loading status. It can be used when
the application needs to indicate to the user that there are running
requests and the user should wait. This component's position is
absolute and the parent wrapper component must have a relative position.

## Active

A loader can be active or disabled.

```
<Loader active/> //Active
<Loader/> //Disabled
```
